# Context

As part of a larger project, I collaborated with other engineers to use software engineering pratices and data science to identify patterns between population sentiments in regards to COVID using tweets.

## Data Annotation

A project with more resources would use machine learning models, NLP extraction methods, or outsource the annotation to other services with [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com).

Unfortunately for this project, the engineers were responsible for the time-consuming, manual annotation of tweet sentiments.

The engineers proceeded to start annotating the tweets which were located in a csv file. This step proved to be slow, and prone to mistakes since the UI used were csv files.

To make this step faster, more reliable, and more comfortable, I created a python script that enables the engineers to quickly annotate using the command line.
